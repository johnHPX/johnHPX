### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?

  My name is Jonatas, I'm backend junior programmer, I really like to study programing and Hacking. I am 18 years old, I am in search of constant knowledge and experiences so that I never stop evolving both as a professional and as a human being. My goal is to become a great and true Software Engineer capable of creating what I want and with a lot of freedom to go where I want to go. I'm still at the beginning... but one day I'll get there!
  
### Work

  I'm not currently working, but soon I hope to get a job in a company or work as a freelancer.

### What am I Studying?

  I'm currently studying Golang and React with Typescript.

### My Programming Experiences

  I already had an experience of 6 months working at Empresa Toukio, working as a Backend Programmer with Golang. Here you can learn a lot about Software development, Documentation, Planning, Communication, Making a Coffee and How to Play Chess lol. It was a very incredible experience for me.
