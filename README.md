### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am i?

```
  My name is Jonatas, I'm backend junior programmer, I really like to study programing and Hacking. I am 18 years old, I am in search of constant knowledge and experiences so that I never stop evolving both as a professional and as a human being. My goal is to become a great and true Software Engineer capable of creating what I want and with a lot of freedom to go where I want to go. I'm still at the beginning... but one day I'll get there!
